# Sourdough Belgian Waffles

This recipe is based on [this recipe by Cultures for Health](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/recipe/sourdough-recipes/sourdough-belgian-waffles/).

## Ingredients

* 200 g sourdough starter (50% water)
* 360 g all purpose flour
* 240 g warm water
* 72 g unsalted butter
* 80 g maple syrup
* 120 g brown sugar
* 4 g salt
* 2.5 g (1/2 tsp.) baking soda
* 2 g (1/2 tsp.) vanilla extract
* 2 eggs
* (Optional) Chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, cooked bacon pieces.

## Procedure

1. Combine the starter, water, and flour in a medium bowl and mix for a few minutes.
2. Cover and leave on the countertop for a few hours, or overnight.
3. Melt the butter.
4. Whisk the remaining ingredients together.
5. Fold this mixture into the sourdough mixture.
6. Preheat and grease a waffle iron.
7. Pour batter into the center of the iron. Close and bake until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.

## Variants
* For a not-too-intense banana flavor, I substituted the maple syrup with 160 g of Pressure-Caramelized Banana Puree (from Modernist Cuisine at Home) and reduced the butter to 51 g.

## Notes
* I'm still working out the kinks on this one, particularly the amount of sugar and syrup that will give the most authentic flavor and consistency.
