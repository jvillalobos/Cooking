# Sourdough Belgian Waffles

This recipe is based on [this recipe by Cultures for Health](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/recipe/sourdough-recipes/sourdough-belgian-waffles/).

## Ingredients

* 200 g sourdough starter (50% water)
* 360 g all purpose flour
* 300 g warm water
* 115 g unsalted butter, cubed and at room temperature
* 80 g maple syrup
* 120 g brown sugar
* 4 g salt
* 2.5 g (1/2 tsp.) baking soda
* 2 g (1/2 tsp.) vanilla extract
* (Optional) Chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, cooked bacon pieces.

## Procedure

1. Whisk the flour, salt, baking soda, and sugar in a medium bowl.
2. Using a stand mixer with a dough hook, mix all ingredients except for the water at medium speed until incorporated. Alternatively, use a wooden spoon or your hands.
3. Gradually add the water until incorporated. The dough will be soft and sticky.
4. Cover and leave on the countertop or refrigerator for a few hours, or overnight.
5. Preheat and grease a waffle iron.
6. Pour batter into the center of the iron. Close and bake until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.

## Variants
* For a not-too-intense banana flavor, I substituted the maple syrup with 160 g of Pressure-Caramelized Banana Puree (from Modernist Cuisine at Home) and reduced the butter to 95 g.
