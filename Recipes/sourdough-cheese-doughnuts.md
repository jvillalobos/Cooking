# Sourdough Cheese Doughnuts (Papanasi)

This recipe is based on [this recipe by Where is My Spoon](https://whereismyspoon.co/romanian-cheese-doughnuts-papanasi/).

## Ingredients

* 200 g sourdough starter (50% water)
* 500 g cottage cheese or cream cheese, drained
* 2 eggs
* 50 g / 60 ml rum
* 2 g (1/2 tsp.) vanilla extract
* 2.5 g (1/2 tsp.) baking soda
* 90 g granulated sugar
* 4 g salt
* 380 g all-purpose flour
* Frying oil
* (Optional) 250 g smetana or cr√®me fraiche to serve. I've used and and enjoyed [this recipe](https://petersfoodadventures.com/2018/08/10/homemade-sour-cream/) for smetana.
* (Optional) Whole fruit runny blueberry jam to serve (or sour cherry, blackberry, black currants jam).

## Procedure

1. With an immersion blender, blend together the cheese, eggs, rum, vanilla extract, baking soda, sugar, and salt.
2. In a bowl, combine the cheese mixture with the flour and starter.
3. Knead with a mixer or a wooden spoon. The dough will be very sticky.
4. Move back to a bowl and ferment overnight.
5. Flour your working surface and hands generously.
6. Divide the dough into 12 balls.
7. Form the doughnuts by rolling the balls into tubes and joining them at the ends.
8. Cover and let rest for another hour.
9. Heat the frying oil in a deep pot to 300 F / 150 C.
10. Fry the doughnuts in batches, ensuring the oil is back at the right temperature before starting a new batch. Fry each batch for about 7 minutes, turning them around a few times.
11. Take the cooked doughnuts out and allow them to cool slightly and drain before serving.

## Variants
* Ginger doughnuts: add 20 g (1 tbsp.) grated ginger and optionally replace the rum with Cointreau.

## Notes
* For a more traditional version of the recipe, don't blend the cheese entirely, leaving some cheese lumps in the dough. Also, divide one of the 12 balls into 11 smaller balls that are also fried and served on top of each doughnut.
