# Almond Torta Chilena

This is a variant of a common Costa Rican dessert, itself a variant of the [mille-feuille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille-feuille). This recipe is based on [this recipe by Perennial Pastimes](https://perennialpastimes.com/2012/11/26/recipe-dulce-de-leche-pastry-cake/) and the almond pie crust recipe from [Modernist Cuisine at Home](https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/).

## Ingredients

* 115 g unsalted butter, cold and cubed
* 154 g all-purpose flour
* 23 g almond flour
* 3 g salt
* 7 g sugar
* 0.9 g (1/4 tsp.) almond extract
* 40 g white wine
* 250 g [dulce de leche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche)
* 65 g sliced almonds

## Procedure

1. Pulse butter, flour, almond flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor.
2. Add wine and almond extract, in batches, and pulse until fully incorporated into a wet dough.
3. Form the dough into a log and divide into 5 equal discs.
4. Wrap the discs individually in plastic wrap and freeze for 30 minutes.
5. Preheat oven to 375 F / 190 C.
6. Take out discs from the freezer, one by one, and roll out into very thin circles. They're easier to handle between sheets of parchment paper or wax paper.
7. Place them over parchment paper on a tray and poke holes in them using a fork.
8. Bake them, in batches if necessary, for 13 minutes.
9. When done, remove parchment paper from the cooked wafer and let cool on a cooling rack.
10. Carefully assemble the pie by placing a cooked wafer, spreading dulce de leche on top, and finally sprinkling sliced almonds. Repeat the process for all layers.

## Notes
* For assembly, I take 80% of the dulce de leche and almonds and mix them together for the first 4 layers. This way you don't get a dry almond layer that makes the pie unstable. The remaining 20% are used on the top layer, separately, for aesthetic purposes.
* It's easier to serve the pie after putting it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. The humidity of the refrigerator and the dulce de leche help consolidate the layers.
* The cooked wafers are very delicate, so be careful when putting them together.
* To roll out the discs, I put them between two sheets of parchment or wax paper and then use a rolling pin. After getting the right size, I carefully remove one of the papers, put it back on loosely, flip the disc with both papers, and carefully remove the second paper. Finally, I cut the excess in the bottom paper before putting it in the oven.
