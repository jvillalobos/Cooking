# No Knead Sourdough Bread

This recipe is based on [this recipe by Sam Sifton](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018028-sourdough-no-knead-bread).

## Ingredients

* 200 g sourdough starter (50% water)
* 550 g bread or all purpose flour, plus more for dusting
* 300 g lukewarm water
* 6 g (1 tsp.) salt

## Procedure

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
2. In another mixing bowl, stir together the water with the sourdough starter, then pour the mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a tea towel and leave it to rise overnight, about 10 to 24 hours.
4. Generously dust a clean kitchen surface with flour.
5. Scoop the dough directly onto the surface, then dust with more flour. With lightly floured hands, gently fold the edges of the dough from the outside in, to form a round loaf.
6. Dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour, sprinkle sesame seeds in a small area about the size of your loaf and place the dough on top of the seeds, seam side down.
7. Lightly dust with additional flour, cover and allow to double in size, about 2 hours.
8. Preheat oven to 450 F / 250 C.
8. Place a covered enamel Dutch oven or heavy pot with a lid into the oven and allow it to heat for 30 minutes or so. Remove the pot from the oven, take off its top, and carefully invert the risen dough into it, so that the seam side is now facing up. (Alternately you can invert the risen dough onto a flour-dusted sheet of parchment paper and lower your loaf into your pot that way.). Put the top back on the pot and return it to the oven.
9. Bake for about 35 minutes, then take the top off the pot and allow it to continue to cook until it is brown and crusty all over, an additional 20 minutes or so.
10. Remove from the oven and put the loaf on a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.
