# Sourdough Focaccia

This recipe is based on [this recipe by Cultures for Health](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/recipe/sourdough-recipes/sourdough-focaccia-rosemary-garlic/).

## Ingredients

* 200 g sourdough starter (50% water)
* 470 g bread or all purpose flour, plus more for dusting
* 250 g water
* 13 g (2 tsp.) salt, divided
* Extra virgin olive oil
* (Optional) Rosemary, grated garlic

## Procedure

1. Combine the starter, water, flour, 10 g salt, and 20 g (2 tbsp.) olive oil in a bowl and mix.
2. Transfer to a floured surface and knead.
3. Cover and ferment for 24 to 48 hours.
4. Generously grease a deep and wide baking dish with olive oil.
5. Carefully move the dough to the dish and spread it out, taking care not to deflate the dough.
6. Cover and rise for a few hours.
7. Preheat oven to 450 F / 250 C.
8. Use your fingers to create indentations in the top of the dough by sinking them in slowly. It should look like divots all over the top of the dough.
9. Drizzle olive oil on top.
10. Sprinkle generously with remaining salt, and optionally chopped rosemary and garlic.
11. Let bread rest for 40 minutes.
12. Place dish in preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top.

## Variants

* Asian-style focaccia: replace olive oil with sesame oil, add minced chives in step 1, and top with sesame seeds in step 10.
* Salted caramel focaccia: replace olive oil with walnut or other nut oil, replace olive oil with cooled salted caramel in step 9, and add more caramel after baking. I also cut the recipe in half for this one, to make a thinner bread.
