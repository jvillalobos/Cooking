# Spotted Dick

This recipe is based on [this recipe from Buzzfeed Tasty](https://tasty.co/recipe/spotted-dick). I'm actually just posting the adjusted ingredients for the cake so the recipe works with a bundt pan.

## Ingredients (cake only)

* Cooking spray or softened unsalted butter, for greasing
* 395 g all purpose flour, plus more for dusting
* 193 g tbsp. unsalted butter, frozen for at least 30 minutes
* 1 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
* 4 tsp. baking powder
* 128 g sugar
* 65 g golden raisins
* 65 g dried currant
* 1 tablespoon lemon zest
* 110 ml milk
* 5 large eggs, lightly beaten

## Procedure

1. Follow the procedure of the [original recipe](https://tasty.co/recipe/spotted-dick). Substitute pudding mold with a bundt pan. I used aluminum foil to wrap over the greased parchment paper and cover the bottom of the pan. Be very careful when lowering it in the pot and taking it out!
