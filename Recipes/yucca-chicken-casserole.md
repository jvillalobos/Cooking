# Yucca and Chicken Casserole

This is a variant of the "Pastel de Yuca" (Yucca Pie or Yucca Casserole) recipe by Odilie Araya Camacho, part of [*Traditional Costa Rican Cuisine, vol 7*](https://github.com/jvillalobos/Cooking/blob/master/Recipes/cocina-tradicional-costarricense/Cocina%20Tradicional%20CR%207%20-%20Zona%20Norte.pdf) (in Spanish), page 17.

## Ingredients

* 2 chicken breasts (with or without bones)
* 2 liters chicken stock
* 8 garlic cloves
* 1 stalk celery
* 1 bunch Mexican coriander
* 1/2 tsp. dry oregano
* 1.5 kg yucca root, peeled and cut into large chunks
* 2 tbsp. Parmesan cheese, grated
* 115 g unsalted butter
* 1 yellow onion, finely chopped
* 1 bell pepper, finely chopped
* 1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped
* 2 slices bacon, chopped
* 1 tbsp. achiote paste
* 1 cup mozzarella cheese, grated
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Procedure

1. Bring chicken stock to a boil.
2. Add garlic cloves, celery, Mexican coriander, oregano, salt, and chicken breasts. Add water if needed.
3. Boil until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.
4. Take the chicken and other solids out of the stock.
5. Once the chicken cools off a little, shred it using two forks.
6. Add the yucca to the stock and boil until tender when poked with a fork.
7. Remove the yucca from the liquid.
8. Puree the yucca along with the butter, 125 ml of the used stock, Parmesan, and salt to taste. Add more stock if needed.
9. Remove any hard fibers from the puree.
10. Preheat oven to 350 F / 180 C.
11. In a pan over medium heat, cook the chopped bacon until the fat melts.
12. Add the onion, pepper, cilantro, and achiote paste, and cook until fragrant.
13. Add the chicken, 125 ml of the used stock, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for a few minutes.
14. On a baking dish, create a layer with half of the puree, a second layer with all of the chicken mixture, a third layer with the remaining puree, and finally the grated cheese on top.
15. Bake for 45 minutes. If desired, finish browning the cheese by broiling.

## Notes
* Don't throw away the stock! It can be frozen and reused.
* Some of the quantities are copied over from the recipe and I didn't have a chance to properly measure them. I'll try to fix them next time.
* I used the Costa Rican Turrialba cheese instead of mozzarella. It's a bit saltier and firmer, but I think it gives the dish a more authentic feel.
