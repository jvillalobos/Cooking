# KFC Style Fried Chicken

This recipe comes from [this Chicago Tribune Article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/recipes/ct-kfc-recipe-test-20160818-story.html), which published the recipe found through a relative of Colonel Sanders. I only made some minor tweaks to it.

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken, cut up
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 1 egg, beaten
* 12 g (2 tsp.) salt
* 302 g all-purpose flour
* 2 g (1.5 tsp.) dried thyme leaves
* 1.3 g (1.5 tsp.) dried basil leaves
* 0.6 g (1 tsp.) dried oregano leaves
* 13 g (1 tbsp.) celery salt
* 4 g (1 tbsp.) ground black pepper
* 8.3 g (1 tbsp.) dried mustard
* 28 g (4 tbsp.) paprika
* 14 g (2 tbsp.) garlic salt
* 6 g (1 tbsp.) ground ginger
* 24 g (3 tbsp.) ground white pepper
* Neutral-tasting frying oil
* MSG for sprinkling (optional)

## Procedure

1. Mix the buttermilk, egg, and salt together in a bowl until combined. Soak the chicken in the buttermilk mixture at room temperature, at least 30 minutes or ideally overnight.
2. Mix the flour in a bowl with all the herbs and spices.
3. Remove chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the chicken pieces in the herb-spice-flour mixture to coat all sides, shaking off excess. Allow to sit on a rack over a baking sheet, 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, heat about 3 inches of the oil in a large Dutch oven (or similar heavy pot with high sides) over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. When temperature is reached, lower the heat to medium to maintain it at 350.
5. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time, being careful not to crowd the pot. Fry until medium golden brown, turning once, 15-18 minutes. Transfer chicken pieces to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Sprinkle with a little MSG, if using. Allow the oil to return to temperature before adding more chicken.
