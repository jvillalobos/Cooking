# Cocina Tradicional Costarricense (Traditional Costa Rican Cuisine)

Compiled by Yanory Álvarez Masís, Chester Rodolfo Urbina Gaitán, and Isabel Badilla Chang for the Costa Rican Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports.

This is a free collection of traditional Costa Rican recipes (in Spanish), from all over the country. The tomes are categorized by region, and they have multiple versions of most recipes. The quality of the recipes varies wildly, and I've only tried a couple. The ones I modify enough to make something interesting will make it to the main collection of recipes.

I'm putting it up here because I couldn't find them in the original source anymore, and it took me a while to find all of them online.
