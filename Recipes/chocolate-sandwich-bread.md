# Chocolate Sandwich Bread

This recipe is based on [this recipe by David Lebovitz](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/chocolate-bread-recipe/) and the white sandwich bread recipe from [Modernist Cuisine at Home](https://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/).

## Ingredients

* 270 g starter dough (50% water)
* 280 g water
* 113 g unsalted butter
* 45 g buttermilk powder or nonfat milk powder
* 690 g all-purpose flour (plus extra flour for coating the pan)
* 60 g unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
* 95 g sugar
* 5 g salt
* 1 g baking soda
* Cooking spray or oil
* 100 g macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped
* 100 g hazelnuts, coarsely chopped

## Procedure

1. Combine water, unsalted butter, and milk in a pot over low heat, whisking occasionally, until the butter melts and the milk is fully blended.
2. Cool to room temperature.
3. Lightly coat a loaf pan with cooking spray or wipe it with oil, and then dust the pan with flour.
4. Combine half the flour with all the sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and starter.
5. Mix manually or using a mixer with a dough hook. Gradually add the milk mixture.
6. Gradually mix the remaining flour until it is fully incorporated.
7. Knead for 8 minutes.
8. Add the nuts and continue kneading until evenly distributed.
9. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Shape it into a rectangle about the size and shape of the loaf pan.
10. Place the dough into the pan, and cover it with plastic wrap or a clean, dry dish towel.
11. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free environment until it has doubled in size, 3-4 hours.
12. Preheat the oven to 390 F / 190 C.
13. Bake the dough for 40-50 minutes.
14. Remove the loaf from the pan immediately, put it on a rack, and cool it completely before slicing.

## Notes

* This bread isn't very sweet. Adding more sugar and chocolate chips like the original recipe will yield a sweeter result.
